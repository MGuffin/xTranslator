#list of strings pairs from source language to destination one. 
#the most convenient is probably English as source -> Another as dest
#you must have, in your data\strings folder, both batch of sources and targets language files (.strings, .dlstrings and .ilstrings).
#just put the main name of the file in the list.
#for example, for Skyrim_english.string just put STRINGS=Skyrim   (STRINGS must be capitalized)
#if you have all relevant files for Update patch it would fit well in first position (as it override old files)
