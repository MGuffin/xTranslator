<div id="head">String Flags:</div>
<br>During the translation process strings can be set (automatically or
manually) with different flags,&nbsp;represented by differents
colors.<br>Each flag have a specific signification:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 544px; height: 213px;" alt="Flags" src="../common/sstflags.gif"><br>
<br>
-Translated [White - Automatic]:&nbsp; Strings translated directly
through the
vocabulary cache are automatically set with this flag.<br>
<br>
-Validated as Complete translation [Blue - User defined]: (shortcut F1)
This is the "user" equivalent
to the translated flag. This strings are considered as "completely
translated", and will be add to the global vocabulary cache if the user
save the SSTStrings for the current addon.<br>
<br>
-Validated as Partial translation [Purple - Auto/: User defined]: (shortcut
F2) The user can
choose to set
a string as "Partially translated" . It's like a&nbsp; "Work In
progress" flag. <br>
Theses strings are saved and loaded in the SSTStrings, if the user work
on the related addon,&nbsp; but are not added to the global
vocabulary cache. Some advanced functionnalities automatically set
relevant strings as Partially Translated, like Search and replace,
EspCompare tool.<br>
<br>
-Heuristic match (LD = Levenstein Distance*):
[Green to Red - Automatic]. Similar Strings can be automatically found
through
an
"Heuristic search" (In Menu, or Shortcut: Ctrl-H). <br>
Strings that are close to the original are Green,
when strings with low match go to the red. These strings are not saved
in the SSTStrings, and not added in the global
vocabulary cache.<br>
When
the panels "AutoTranslation is active" (Main form, Bottom Panel),
clicking on any string will show all similar strings sorted with their
distance from the source. (Green + LD = 0 is the best match possible.)<br>
the + next to the LD number means that more than one result has been found by the heuristic processor<br><br>
-UnTranslated [Red, without LD result, Automatic &amp; User
defined]: (using the shortcut F4 resets
the state of a string as Untranslated an remove any translation) these
string have not been
translated at all. These strings are not saved in the SSTStrings, and
not added in the global
vocabulary cache.<br>
<br>
-Alias Warning [Yellow - Automatic]: String are colored in Yellow when
&lt;Alias&gt; reference do&nbsp;not match between original and
translated String. There is a special Panel in the Edit Form that
helps to fix this kind of issue. This flag override all others. If a
string has been validated, it will be saved in the SSTStrings,
and&nbsp; added in the global
vocabulary cache.<br>
